My attempt at a simple operating system with interrupts, a syscall system, a filesystem, a built in text editor and C compiler that hosts simple games (e.g., tetris).
I have a lot of ideas for where I can go with this, and it's likely that a lot of my other projects might be implemented in some form in this operating system.

Inspired by the x86 version of xv6, and my college operating systems course.
